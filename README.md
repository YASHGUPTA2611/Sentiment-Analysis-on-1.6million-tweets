# Sentiment-Analysis-on-1.6million-tweets

Hi ðŸ˜€

In this repository I applied the state of Natural Language Processing on 1.6 million tweets. Basically the data has been collected through Twitter API.

After the NLP task i have applied a Bidirectional LSTM to the vectors and make a model which helps us to tells the Sentiment of a tweet. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive).

You can find the dataset files from Kaggle :- https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
